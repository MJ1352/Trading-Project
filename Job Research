I'm a chemical engineering student but I came across a winter internship for a trading company. 
I've got an interest in programming (python & matlab) but I don't really know anything about trading yet.
So in this repository I will detail my learnings. 
I'm a beginner in this space so keen to hear any knowledge or experience you may have
Im hoping the skills I've gained in Chem Eng will be somewhat helpful but theres still a Huge learning curve

Options Pricing Theory

From the Very basics whats an option?
In finance, an option is a contract which gives the buyer (the owner or holder of the option) the right, but not the obligation, 
to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price prior to or on a specified date, depending on the 
form of the option.

-So an option price is the contract price of a stock or other asset at a specific time

Ok, what determines the price/value of an option?

The Price of an option has two components
Intrinsic Value - Difference between underlying spot price (current price) and the strike price
Time value - Always greater than intrinsic value, with extra money to compensate for risk seller is taking

PRICING MODELS
BLACK SCHOLES
PDE - widely used though often with adjustments surely it can't be as bad as navier stokes

The key idea is to hedge so as to eliminate risk
"Continuously revised delta hedging'

Has one parameter - easy!
 that cannot be directly observed: The average future volatility - not so easy
 
 The option value is increasing in this parameter, it can be inverted to produce a volatility surface - used for model calibration
 
 Assumptions
 -Market has at least 1 risky asset and 1 riskless asset
 -Riskless rate is constant
 -Instantaneous log return us random walk with drift - geometric Brownian motion, assume its drift & volatility const
 -Stock doesnt pay dividend
 
 Market assumptions
 -No arbitrage
 -borrow and lend any amounts at riskless rate
 -buy and sell any amount
 -no transaction fees

Formula
{\frac {\partial V}{\partial t}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\sigma ^{2}S^{2}{\frac {\partial ^{2}V}{\partial S^{2}}}+rS{\frac {\partial V}{\partial S}}-rV=0
